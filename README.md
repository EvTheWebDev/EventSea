### About EventSea

EventSea is an app for students, _by students_. It is an event hub where different student organizations on a college campus can create an account, post events, and find collaborators and members easily. Orgs are able to communicate with each other, and can send announcements to their members with the push of a button.

With EventSea, students can:

- Create and manage organization accounts
- Post events (meetings, social gatherings, talks, etc.)
- Find collaborators and members across different campus orgs
- Communicate via announcements to members with a simple button click

EventSea is designed to streamline campus life: whether you run a club, organize a study group, or just want to check out what’s going on — EventSea brings it all together.
